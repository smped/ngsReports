Changes in version 1.0.0
+ Initial Bioconductor release version

Changes in version 0.99.8 (2019-04-03)
+ **This is a breaking change!** Significant changes to most functions have been implemented
+ Extracting modules is no longer performed by individual functions, but is now performed using the function getModule
+ FastqcFileLists objects are no longer defined and the class FastqcFile has been made into the private class .FastqcFile
+ FastqcDataList objects have names attributes and can now be subset using names
+ The function fileName has been renamed as fqName to clarify that it refers to the underlying Fastq file for a Fastqc report
+ All log file imports are now handled by the single function importNgsLogs
+ Most plot functions have been renamed with shorter names, e.g. plotOverrepresentedSequences is now plotOverrep
+ The FastQC version is now obtained using fqcVersion not Version
+ The functions genomes() and transcriptomes() have been removed and this information is now obtained using gcAvail(object, type)
+ The function getGcDistn() has been renamed as estGcDistn() to avoid any confusion with getGC() which works on TheoreticalGC objects.

Changes in version 0.99.1 (2019-02-03)
+ Removed Remotes from DESCRIPTION
+ Added getGcDistribution to enable calculation of GC Content Distributions from FastaFiles

Changes in version 0.99.0 (2019-02-01)
